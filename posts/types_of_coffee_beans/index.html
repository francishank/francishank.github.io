<p>Coffee, one of the most beloved beverages worldwide, owes its diverse flavors and characteristics to the different species of coffee beans. While there are numerous species, four primary ones dominate the global coffee market. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll explore each species in detail.</p>

<li><strong>Origin</strong>: Arabica coffee is indigenous to the highlands of Ethiopia and is cultivated worldwide in regions with suitable climates, including Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-robusta-coffea-canephora">2. Robusta (Coffea canephora)</h2>
<p>Robusta coffee beans are the second most commonly cultivated species of coffee, accounting for about 30-40% of global coffee production. These beans are known for their robust flavor and higher caffeine content compared to Arabica beans.</p>
