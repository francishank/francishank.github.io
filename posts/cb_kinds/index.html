<h2 id="processing-methods">Processing Methods</h2>
<p>Coffee beans undergo various processing methods after harvesting, which significantly influence their flavor and aroma. Some common processing methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Washed Process:</strong> In this method, the outer skin of the coffee cherry is removed before the beans are fermented and washed to remove any remaining fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Process:</strong> Also known as the dry process, this method involves drying the whole coffee cherries in the sun, allowing the beans to absorb flavors from the fruit.</li>
<li><strong>Honey Process:</strong> This method involves removing the outer skin of the coffee cherry but leaving some of the sticky fruit intact during drying, resulting in a sweeter flavor profile.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Coffee beans are graded based on various factors such as size, shape, and defects. The grading system varies depending on the country of origin, but common grades include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialty Grade:</strong> These are the highest quality beans, free from defects and with optimal flavor characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Premium Grade:</strong> Beans in this category may have slight defects but are still considered of good quality.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange Grade:</strong> Beans in this grade may have more defects and are typically used for commercial blends.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brewing-tips">Brewing Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use freshly ground coffee beans for the best flavor.</li>
<li>Experiment with different grind sizes and brewing methods to find your preferred taste.</li>
<li>Store coffee beans in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture to maintain freshness.</li>
</ul>
